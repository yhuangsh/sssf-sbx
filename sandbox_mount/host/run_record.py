"""The run record — the only state shared across the six sandbox phases.

Each phase (create, fill, setup, execute, observe, teardown) is a separate
process, so nothing survives between them except what is on disk. Teardown has
no other way to learn which VM to destroy and which commits to harvest: lose the
record and the run cannot be cleaned up. One JSON file per run, keyed by run_id,
under .sandbox/runs/ (gitignored).

Usage:
    run_record.py create  <run-id>
    run_record.py get     <run-id> [field]
    run_record.py set     <run-id> key=value [key=value ...]
    run_record.py close   <run-id>
    run_record.py list
    run_record.py path    <run-id>
    run_record.py new-id  <task>

`get <run-id> <field>` prints the bare value so shell can capture it:
    RUN_VM=$(sandbox_mount/host/run_record.py get my-run vm_name)

Stdlib only, on purpose: this runs on the host before any toolchain exists and
must never be the reason a teardown cannot start.
