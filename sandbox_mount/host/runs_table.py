"""Render the run-record table for `just runs`.

Lives in a file rather than embedded in the recipe for two reasons. An
unindented line inside a just recipe body TERMINATES the recipe, so embedded
python is a parse error waiting to happen. And a tab-delimited shell read-loop
over records with optional fields mis-assigns columns; one python pass renders
the table with no field shifting.

Reads run records from stdin as JSON; takes the live VM list as argv[1] (a
comma-separated string, or the literal `__unknown__` when the control plane
could not be reached). "unknown" is deliberately distinct from "gone": a failed
lookup must never render as "every VM is destroyed".
