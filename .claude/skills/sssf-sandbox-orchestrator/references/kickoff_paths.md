# The two kickoff paths

When work goes into a sandbox, there are two distinct ways to fire it, and they differ in *who pulls
the trigger inside the box*. Both are supported; they are lanes, not rivals.

---

## Path 1 — Direct: the host fires the factory itself

```bash
just sbx lifecycle execute <run-id> "<prompt-or-path>" "<config>"
```

The host ssh-es in and detaches `nohup just --shell bash --shell-arg -c adw sdlc ...` directly. **No
agent mediates the kickoff** — the deterministic factory process starts because a deterministic recipe
started it. The recipe records the pid in the run record, output lands in `run.log`, and the ADW's own
tracer streams every phase into `sssf.db`.

**Properties:** reproducible (same prompt bytes + same config = the same run, which is what makes
best-of-N comparable) · zero orchestration tokens · pid-tracked and killable · one detached SDLC per box
at a time.

**Reach for it when:** the work order is already shaped (`prompts/*.md` passed verbatim), you are fanning
out N boxes and need the arms identical, or you intend to walk away and read the trace later. **This is
the default for real work.**

## Path 2 — Agent-mediated: the host asks the in-box agent to kick off the work

```bash
just sbx run agent <run-id> "run the redesign in prompts/06... with the top-speed roster, then watch it"
```

The host talks to the **pi session inside the sandbox** — the resumable session whose id was minted at
CREATE — and *that agent* runs the factory: it chooses the ADW, shapes the invocation, launches
`just adw ...`, watches it, and reports back. Interactive attach
([access_a_running_sandbox.md](../cookbooks/access_a_running_sandbox.md) flow B) is the same lane with a
human in the seat.

**Properties:** judgment at the kickoff point (which ADW, which roster, how to phrase the prompt) ·
conversational — you can ask "how is it going?" and get an answer with context · resumable memory across
the run's whole life · costs agent tokens, but they ride the **roster's own providers**, so they land in
the same `sssf.db` as everything else · non-deterministic by nature.

**Reach for it when:** the ask is fuzzy and needs shaping before it becomes a work order, something
mid-run needs diagnosis or intervention, or you want the box to self-manage a sequence ("run the SDLC,
and if tests fail, run build-test again").

### The delegation contract: equip the agent first

Every work-kickoff delegation MUST open with the briefing read, then the work. This kernel has **no
factory skill** — the in-box delegate's briefing is the repo's own `README.md` plus the recipe list:

```bash
just sbx run agent <run-id> "If you have not already: READ README.md and run just --list adw. Then: <the work>"
```

The "if you have not already" guard makes the preamble safe to repeat — a session that already read the
briefing skips straight to the work instead of re-reading it every delegation.

The in-box agent is a bare pi session in `app/` — it has the repo, but nothing has briefed it on the
factory: which ADWs exist, the orchestrator rules, or that in-sandbox `just` needs
`--shell bash --shell-arg -c`. `README.md` is that briefing, and it ships in the clone. An unequipped
delegate improvises; an equipped one routes. The preamble goes on the **first work turn** — the session
is resumable, so later turns ("how is it going?") ride the memory and need no re-read.

## The boundary line

**Path 1 is a command; Path 2 is a delegation.** Direct kickoff keeps the host's guarantee: what ran is
exactly what you typed. Agent-mediated kickoff trades that guarantee for judgment — the agent may run
something better than you asked for, or different from it. That is the whole trade, stated plainly.

Two operational deltas to know: an agent-launched ADW does **not** write its pid into the run record
(only `lifecycle execute` does — though the ADW still registers its own processes in `sssf.db`, so
`just obs procs` works either way), and the agent must use `--shell bash --shell-arg -c` plus the full
detach incantation if it walks away from a long run — the recipes encode that; the agent must not
hand-roll it wrong.

Both paths converge on the same trace: whichever finger pulled the trigger, the factory writes the same
`sssf.db`, and observability does not care who started it.
